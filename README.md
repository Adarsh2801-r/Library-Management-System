# Library-Management-System-
The library management system maintains all information about the library staff, customers who borrow (divided into 2 tables – Student and Faculty), details of all books
, issued books status, returned books status and penalty (in case of overdue) details. It would be a herculean task to keep track of all these information manually. Thus we developed
a stand alone desktop application to store and automate the operations which would help the library staff to manage daily activity. 

Technology used:
* Programming language – JAVA
* RDBMS - MySQL
* Development platform – NetBeans JAVA SE
* Other tools like LucidChart/dbdiagrams etc. for ER Modelling, database design etc.
